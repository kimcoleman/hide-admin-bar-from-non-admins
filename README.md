### Welcome to the Hide Admin Bar from Non-Admins GitHub Repository
This plugin hides the WordPress Toolbar (admin bar) for all visitors and users without the 'administrator' role. It's a very simple plugin with no settings to configure.

* Use this plugin for sites with only one admin who needs access to the dashboard and the admin bar.
* This plugin is super lightweight, with just a few lines of code.
* If you need to show the toolbar for other user roles, use the filter `habfna_show_admin_bar_roles`.

This plugin is a tweak of the code by Yoast to hide the admin bar for non-admins only.
